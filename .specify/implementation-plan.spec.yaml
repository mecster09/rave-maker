    objectives:
      - Build simulation engine for sites, subjects, and visits.
      - Implement YAML-based configuration loader.
      - Add realistic data generation via faker.
    deliverables:
      - simulator.ts
      - generator.ts
      - config.ts
      - study.config.yaml
    timeline: 2 weeks

  - id: phase2-api
    title: Phase 2 — REST API Interface
    objectives:
      - Create Express API endpoints for study, sites, subjects, and forms.
      - Enable concurrent simulations.
      - Add basic logging.
    deliverables:
      - server.ts
      - api.spec.yaml
    timeline: 2 weeks

  - id: phase3-realism
    title: Phase 3 — Realistic Study Behavior
    objectives:
      - Support delayed/missed visits and partial forms.
      - Add configurable queries and simulated updates over time.
      - Introduce “speed factor” control.
    deliverables:
      - generator.ts (enhanced)
      - simulation.spec.yaml
    timeline: 3 weeks

  - id: phase4-cloud
    title: Phase 4 — Azure Deployment
    objectives:
      - Containerize the simulator with Docker.
      - Deploy to Azure Container Apps or AKS.
