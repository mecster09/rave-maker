  title: Engineering & Architectural Principles (V2)
  version: 2.0.0
  description: |
    Defines guiding principles for the Medidata RAVE Mock Study Simulator project with priorities and enforcement levels.

principles:
  - id: modular-architecture
    priority: high
    enforcement: "Code structure, CI tests"
    title: Modular and Extensible
    description: |
      The simulator is decomposed into independent modules (API, simulation, configuration)
      to allow concurrent studies and separate scaling in Azure.

  - id: configuration-first
    priority: high
    enforcement: "Schema validation, CI tests"
    title: Configuration Driven
    description: |
      Every simulation parameter must be defined via a YAML config file to ensure reproducibility,
      easy tweaking, and transparent version control.

  - id: realism
    priority: high
    enforcement: "Test coverage for visit patterns"
    title: Realistic Study Behavior
    description: |
      Simulations must mimic real-world clinical trial patterns, including delayed visits,
      missed visits, partial forms, and realistic query rates.

  - id: observability
    priority: medium
    enforcement: "Logging required"
    title: Observability and Monitoring
    description: |
      Simulation activity should be logged and measurable for performance testing, using metrics
      such as data generation rate and subject progression.

  - id: cloud-ready
    priority: high
    enforcement: "Docker containerization"
    title: Cloud Native
    description: |
      Must run as a stateless Node.js/TypeScript service deployable to Azure Container Apps or AKS.

  - id: maintainable
    priority: high
    enforcement: "Linting, tests, code reviews"
    title: Maintainable Codebase
    description: |
      Follows TypeScript strict mode, linting, and TDD principles with Jest for testing and
      automated CI/CD pipeline integration.
